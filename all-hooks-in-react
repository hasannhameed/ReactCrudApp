ðŸ”¹ 1. Basic Hooks
These are the most commonly used hooks for state and effects.

Hook	Description
useState	Manages component state (e.g., counters, form inputs).
useEffect	Handles side effects (e.g., API calls, event listeners).
useContext	Accesses global state using React.createContext().
ðŸ”¹ 2. Performance Optimization Hooks
These hooks help improve performance by memoizing values or functions.

Hook	Description
useMemo	Caches expensive calculations to prevent unnecessary recomputation.
useCallback	Caches function references to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
ðŸ”¹ 3. Reference & DOM Manipulation Hooks
These hooks allow working with DOM elements and mutable values without triggering re-renders.

Hook	Description
useRef	Stores mutable values or DOM references without causing re-renders.
useImperativeHandle	Customizes a ref to expose specific methods to parent components.
ðŸ”¹ 4. Lifecycle & State Management Hooks
For handling complex state logic and lifecycle events.

Hook	Description
useReducer	Alternative to useState for complex state logic (similar to Redux).
useLayoutEffect	Similar to useEffect, but runs before the UI is painted.
useInsertionEffect	Runs before CSS-in-JS styles are inserted (for UI libraries).
ðŸ”¹ 5. Transition & UI Optimization Hooks
These hooks help improve UI performance.

Hook	Description
useTransition	Marks state updates as "transitions", allowing smoother rendering.
useDeferredValue	Delays updating a state value to avoid UI blocking.
ðŸ”¹ 6. Debugging & Utility Hooks
For debugging and generating unique values.

Hook	Description
useDebugValue	Displays debug information in React DevTools.
useId	Generates unique IDs (for accessibility & forms).
ðŸ”¹ 7. Server Components & External Store Hooks
Hooks designed for React Server Components and external state management.

Hook	Description
useSyncExternalStore	Syncs state with external stores (used in Redux, Zustand, etc.).
useOptimistic	Optimistically updates UI before receiving a server response.
ðŸ”¹ 8. Experimental Hooks
These are not officially stable but are available for testing.

Hook	Description
useEvent	Optimizes event handlers without re-rendering (experimental).
